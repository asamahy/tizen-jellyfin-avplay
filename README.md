#### Note:
For Older Samsung TV Models if you are running out of space even though you are not actually using it (Samsung Bloat)
here is the method to reset and clear some space:

```
Under the Samsung logo on the TV you have a small black button about 2-3cm in from the bottom edge, 
and with the tv turned on:
1. press the button at the logo for 5-10 seconds.
2. Release the button.
3. press the powerbutton on the TV Remote for 5-10 seconds.
4. TV goes black and then restarts after a while. This is the flash reset
```
